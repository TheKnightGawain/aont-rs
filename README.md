# AONT-RS
A computationly secure and storage efficient secret splitting algorithm that combines an [All-Or-Nothing-Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-or-nothing_transform) with [Rabin's IDA](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/doc/10.1.1.116.8657).

The original paper describing the algorithm can be foud [here](http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/papers/FAST-2011.pdf).
